S.A.M -> Single Abstract Methods or Functional Interfaces are interfaces that only have one method.

Lambda - these can only be used on Functional Interfaces.

Collections:
    List - When sequence matters.
    Set - When duplicates isn't allowed.
    Map - When finding something by key matters.

Interfaces can only extend other interfaces. It cannot extend classes. The "Implements" keyword is reserved or used only for interfaces.
The "Extends" keyword is only applicable on classes, but it can be used on interfaces when you extend other interfaces. It won't work if you extend a class to an interface or vice versa.
